# TS libraries

## Setup

```
pnpm i
```

## Run

```
pnpm dev
```

This will run [run.ts](run.ts) file with [tsx](https://github.com/esbuild-kit/tsx).

## Run with Bun

I often prefer to run things with [Bun](https://bun.sh/) if library supports.

```
pnpm dev:bun
```

## Publish libraries

Need to setup a nice way to export things inside [lib](lib) folder to NPM.

## File structure

- [lib](lib) - library code
- [try](try) - trying things out

## Deno

I also am [exploring using Deno](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/deno) as it has some interesting ideas/libraries.

## Discuss / help

Search for [existing issues](../../issues) or open [new one](../../issues/new/choose).
