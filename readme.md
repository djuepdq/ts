> TS libraries + testing code

## File structure

- [lib](lib) - TS libraries
- [src](src) - testing out TS code
  - [main.ts](src/main.ts) - use file to run code quickly

## Setup

Everything is driven using [bun](https://bun.sh/) commands.

```
bun i
```

## Run

```
bun dev
```

Runs: `tput reset && bun src/main.ts`

```
bun dev:node
```

Runs: `tput reset && tsx src/main.ts`

## Publish libraries

## Deno

Exploring use of [Deno in separate repo](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/deno) as it has interesting ideas/libraries. Might become part of this repo eventually.

The tasks to do are outlined in [GitHub issues](../../issues) and in [todo.md](todo.md) (sorted by priority).

If issue/idea you have is not there, [open new issue](../../issues/new/choose) or [start discussion](../../discussions).
