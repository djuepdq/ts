# TS libraries

## Setup

Everything is driven using [bun](https://bun.sh/) commands.

```
bun i
```

## Run

```
bun run dev
```

Runs [run.ts](run.ts) file with bun.

```
bun run dev:node
```

Runs [run.ts](run.ts) file with [tsx](https://github.com/esbuild-kit/tsx).

<!-- ## Publish libraries

Need to setup a nice way to export things inside [lib](lib) folder to NPM. -->

<!-- ## File structure

- [lib](lib) - library code
- [try](try) - trying things out -->

## Deno

[Exploring using Deno](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/deno) too as it has some interesting ideas/libraries.
