# TS

> TS libraries and other code

## File structure

- [packages](packages) - TS packages
  - [util](packages/util) - Utility functions
- [try](try) - trying various TS code/libraries

## Setup

[Bun](https://bun.sh/) is used to run things.

```
bun i
```

## Run

I use this repo to test TS code fast. Create a file `run.ts` in root, if you want to be able to run below command.

```
bun dev
```

Runs: `tput reset && bun --watch run.ts`

## Tests

```
bun test:watch
```

## Publish libraries

> **Warning**
> I still don't know how to publish libraries in TS well. Below instructions are incomplete. If you know how to publish TS packages, please contact me on [X](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev) ‚ô•Ô∏è

Thinking of trying [this approach with Deno](https://dev.to/jlarky/creating-an-npm-package-in-2024-deno-dnt-3467).

```
tsup src/index.ts --format esm --dts
```

Will create a `dist` folder out of exported functions.

Update version number in package.json and commit changes.

Then you can run:

```
npm publish
```

## Deno

Exploring use of [Deno in separate repo](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/deno) as it has interesting ideas/libraries. Might become part of this repo too.

## Contribute

Always open to useful ideas or fixes in form of issues or PRs.

Can [open new issue](../../issues/new/choose) (search [existing issues](../../issues) first) or [start discussion](../../discussions).

It's okay to submit draft PR as you can get help along the way to make it merge ready.
