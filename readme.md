# TS

## File structure

- [packages](packages) - TS packages
- [src](src) - testing out TS code
  - [main.ts](src/main.ts) - use file to run code quickly

## Setup

Everything is driven using [bun](https://bun.sh/) commands.

```
bun i
```

## Run

```
bun run dev
```

Runs: `tput reset && bun src/main.ts`

```
bun run dev:node
```

Runs: `tput reset && tsx src/main.ts`

## Publish packages

> TODO:

## Deno

Explore using [Deno in separate repo](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/deno) as it has interesting ideas/libraries. Might become part of this repo eventually.

## Contribute

The tasks to do are outlined in [existing issues](../../issues) or [below](#tasks) (until I setup nice GitHub sync).

If issue/idea you have is not there, [open new issue](../../issues/new/choose) or [start discussion](../../discussions).

Any PR with code/doc improvements is welcome. ✨

There is also a [personal Discord](https://discord.com/invite/TVafwaD23d) you can join for more indepth discussions related to this repo or [others](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev#src).
